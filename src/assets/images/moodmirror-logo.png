This is a placeholder for the MoodMirror logo PNG file.

To create the actual PNG file, you would need to:
1. Use the SVG file I created (moodmirror-logo.svg)
2. Convert it to PNG using an image editor or online converter
3. Save it as moodmirror-logo.png in this directory

The SVG file contains a complete, scalable logo design that represents the MoodMirror app with:
- A circular mirror design with a gradient background
- A simple, friendly face representing emotions
- The app's primary color scheme (#3f51b5 and #7986cb)
- Decorative elements that enhance the visual appeal
